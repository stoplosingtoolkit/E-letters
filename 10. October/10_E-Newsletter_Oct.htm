					Area</font></b></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
					<font face="Cambria" size="4">Once your child starts school, 
					there are several required  changes in their room&#8217;s layout. 
					Now, a study place is a must, a place where the little 
					scholar can prepare for school, learn and do his or her 
					homework.<br>
					<br>
					The study place has to be regularly near the window so that 
					his arm will not place a shadow on the books in front of 
					him. According to this rule, if we are talking about a 
					right-handed child, the light must be on the left, and if 
					talking about a left-handed child, the light must be on the 
					right.<br>
					<br>
					The furniture must include a desk and some small cabinets or 
					a small bookcase.<br>
					<br>
					The study table or desk must have at least 24&quot; X 35&quot; and its 
					height and inclination has to be adjustable. There must be 
					some kind of drawers next to it or in it to deposit books, 
					papers, pens and other school stuff.<br>
					<br>
					For this same purpose, the parents must consider buying a 
					bookcase or a cabinet for books, which fits the room and the 
					height of your child. For an optimal use of space, a desk 
					with a study table and some shelves can be chosen.<br>
					<br>
					Natural lighting has to be supplemented or maintained by a 
					local light. This is why the desk must have on it a lamp 
					with an adjustable arm, placed in such a way that it can 
					focalize the light precisely to the point it is needed. The 
					chair must have an adjustable height, fitting the height of 
					the young scholar.<br>
					<br>
					Of course a computer is a necessary object in the child&#8217;s 
					room, even in the early student&#8217;s room. Used either for fun 
					or study, it has to become a familiar instrument for the 
					little one.<br>
					<br>
					An &quot;L&quot; shaped desk allows a good position for the computer, 
					with the monitor on one side or in the corner. Be careful 
					because the distance from the monitor  to the eyes of 
					the person using the computer has to be of 20&quot; - 27&quot;. To 
					better respect this distance, some desks are equipped with a 
					special space for the monitor, positioned a little higher 
					than the actual desk.</font></p></td>
