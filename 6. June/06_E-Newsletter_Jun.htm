					All his life Ole had heard about an amazing family 
					tradition. His father, grandfather and great-grandfather had 
					all been able to walk on water on their 21st birthdays. They 
					walked across the lake on their way to the boat club for 
					their first legal drink.<br>
					<br>
					When his 21st birthday came around, Ole and his pal took a 
					boat to the middle of the lake. Ole stepped out of the boat 
					and nearly drowned! <br>
					<br>
					Confused, he went to see his grandmother. He asked, 
					&quot;Grandma, it&#8217;s my 21st birthday, why can&#8217;t I walk across the 
					lake like my father, his father, and his father too?&quot;<br>
					<br>
					Granny looked into Ole's eyes and said, &quot;But their birthdays 
					were in January. <br>
					Yours is in June!&quot; </font></p>

					<b><font face="Verdana" size="4" color="#36C">How to Attract Birds to 
					Your Garden</font></b></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
					<font face="Cambria" size="4">First off &#8230; birds will be 
					attracted by the geographic location of your garden. To find 
					out which birds frequent your area, consult the specialty 
					magazines and the internet. Libraries and book stores have 
					books based on migration and on the routes that some bird 
					species take to get to their summer or winter residence.
					</font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
					<font face="Cambria" size="4">Birds need water. This is 
					highly important. A bath or a pool, no matter the size or 
					the material, would instantly attract many bird families, 
					even wild ducks and geese. </font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
					<font face="Cambria" size="4">If you could also arrange a 
					place where they could find some food, bird seeds, bread or 
					anything else they might like, that would increase the 
					chances they made an appearance in your garden. (Almost all 
					birds prefer sunflower seeds, which are extremely easy to 
					find and inexpensive.) Before buying the seeds, you should 
					make a list with all the birds that are in the area and with 
					every bird&#8217;s food preferences to ensure you can provide food 
					for many types of birds present.</font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
					<font face="Cambria" size="4">Another thing to consider is 
					to keep away from the garden all the things that might scare 
					or disturb birds. </font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
					<font face="Cambria" size="4">Animals like the neighbor&#8217;s 
					dogs can scare the birds. Try and ask the neighbors to keep 
					the dogs chained or in the house, because many birds fear 
					dogs.</font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
					<font face="Cambria" size="4">Also, you must know that some 
					birds do not agree with each other, so that a certain 
					species might avoid your garden because there is another 
					species in it. </font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
					<font face="Cambria" size="4">Some can also stay away 
					because of the fact you have children and the noise is too 
					loud, and others can stay away because the place doesn&#8217;t 
					look natural enough. </font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
					<font face="Cambria" size="4">Bottom line with all this is 
					to do a bit of study to know what birds like and don&#8217;t like 
					&#8230; their nature and habits&#8230; it all works together to bring 
					our feathered friends to the backyard.</font></p>
