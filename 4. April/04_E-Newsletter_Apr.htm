					At this point, the officer calls for backup and in no time 
					10 police cars surround the stopped speeder. The sergeant on 
					the scene approaches the car and orders the man to open his

					the man's driver's license. The man pulls out a valid 
					license and vehicle registration.<br>
					<br>
					&quot;I don't get it,&quot; the sergeant says, &quot;My officer here says 
					you told him you had no license or registration and that you 
					stole this car.&quot; The man shakes his head and says, &quot;I bet 
					that liar told you I was speeding too.&quot;</font></p>

					<font face="Cambria" size="4">If you currently work in an 
					office where light is limited, getting light during the day 
					may be challenging for you. If you feel really drowsy and 
					tired during the first hours of work in the office, chances 
					are your body temperature isn't rising fast enough, most 
					likely because you haven't been exposed to enough light, or 
					haven't had enough activity!<br>
					<br>
					If you work in an office, or at home, a good idea is to get 
					a &#8220;bright light box.&#8221; Bright light boxes are machines that 
					artificially produce light at high intensities, from 5,000 
					luxes to up to 10,000 luxes. <br>
					<br>
					They're a bit pricy, but a great investment if you or your 
					employer values your energy levels while you're at work. 
					They can range from $150 to $300 in price.<br>
					<br>
					But if you work in a place where your employer depends on 
					your ability to function properly and with full energy, you 
					could give them this article and convince them to invest in 
					a few of them.<br>
					<br>
					Bright light therapy also has a connection with our emotions 
					and daytime mood; it has been known to cure depression and other 
					mental disorders. <br>
					<br>
					Lack of light in the winter is one of the main causes of 
					winter depression, and why people generally sleep longer in 
					the winter.</font></p>
