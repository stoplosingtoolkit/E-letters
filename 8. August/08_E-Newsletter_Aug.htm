					An engineer was crossing a road when a frog called out to

					He put the frog in his pocket.<br>
					<br>
					The frog said, &quot;If you kiss me and turn me back into a 
					beautiful princess, I will stay with you for one week.&quot; <br>
					<br>
					Then the frog asked, &quot;What is the matter? I've told you I'm 
					a beautiful princess. Why won't you kiss me?&quot;<br>
					<br>
					He said, &quot;Look I'm an engineer. I don't have time for a

					No matter what your job is, you should always have  enough 
					needed energy to perform it. Eat well - you won&#8217;t get fat, 
					but you have to eat as much as you need in order to not  feel 
					hungry while at work. That will clearly affect your ability 
					to do the job.<br>
					<br>
					Therefore, a day of your work life should be divided into 
					stages that can ensure you get the proper nutrients for peak 
					performance. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you work from 9 AM to 5 PM 
					or if you work all night.<br>
					<br>
					<strong>Long Run Persons</strong><br>
					<br>
					If you are a &quot;long run person,&quot; you are on your feet the 
					entire day so the amount of physical effort you are making 
					is significant. Your body needs energy from morning until 
					evening. You must keep the sugar levels stable with the help 
					of complex hydrocarbonates. You will be like a little ant if 
					you start out your day with cereal and milk, you eat for lunch 
					soup and vegetables with cheese and in the evening you can 
					save yourself some lasagna and salad.<br>
					<br>
					<strong>Night Stars</strong><br>
					<br>
					If you are a &quot;night star&quot; your work hours keep going until 
					the wee morning hours. You need food for feeling okay and 
					happy, combating depression that can often occur during 
					nights. Vitamin B1 is the one that will keep you smiling all 
					night. Your day should start out with a breakfast of bread 
					and honey and the lunch should consist of pasta and 
					vegetables. You can end your day with a dinner of barbecue chicken 
					 and salad.<br>
					<br>
					<strong>Office Angel</strong><br>
					<br>
					If you are an &quot;office angel&quot; then you are performing intense 
					mental activities and a low physical effort. Your body needs 
					&quot;intelligent&quot; food, that would give energy to the brain and 
					nerves, that means nutrients rich in vitamins B and C. For 
					breakfasts you can eat bananas and yogurt, at lunch 
					scrambled eggs and toasted bread and for dinner potatoes, 
					fish and vegetables. </font></p>
