					<font face="Cambria" size="4">A minister waited in line to 
					have his car filled with gas just before a long holiday 
					weekend. The attendant worked quickly, but there were many 
					cars ahead and in front of&nbsp; him. Finally, the attendant 
					motioned the minister toward a vacant pump.<br>
					<br>
					&quot;Reverend,&quot; said the young man, &quot;Sorry about the delay. It 
					seems as if everyone waits until the last minute to get 
					ready for a long trip.&quot;<br>

					Inspirational</font></b></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
					<font face="Cambria" size="4">A tiny garden can bring you 
					closer to nature as you tend the plants with special care 
					and watch them grow.<br>
					<br>
					It could be a niche in a corner of the yard, a raised bed of 
					flowers or vegetables, a window box or two or a container 
					garden on the deck. In any case, the compact garden takes 
					less time and work. The satisfaction comes from working with 
					each individual plant.<br>
					<br>
					For most flowers and vegetables, consider a spot that gets 
					morning sun and afternoon shade. If your place is shady, 
					search for shade-loving plants with greenery or flowers that 
					may be planted under an ornamental tree.<br>
					<br>
					Adding a wooden bench or chair will give you a place to 
					relax in your niche. You could add a sun-dial, a birdbath or 
					trellises for your climbing vines.<br>
					<br>
					Men particularly enjoy building a rose garden. These cost a 
					little more to start, but with proper care the roses will 
					come back bigger and more beautiful with each passing year.<br>
					<br>
					Roses are very attractive as they bloom in sunny niches, 
					raised beds, or even when growing in wooden wine barrels 
					from the garden store.<br>
					<br>
					Container gardening is a pleasant alternative to having a 
					garden in the yard. Containers come in all shapes and 
					sizes. They can be put on trays with wheels so you can move 
					them whenever you want. Or they can be put on stands to make 
					a more dramatic statement. And you don't need &quot;mud shoes&quot; to 
					tend them after a rain.<br>
					<br>
					Plastic containers require less water than clay pots. Soil 
					in clay pots dries out faster.</font></p>
