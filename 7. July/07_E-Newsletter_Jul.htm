					<b><font face="Verdana" size="4" color="#36C">Why Not Try Spanish 
					Cuisine?</font></b></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
					<font face="Cambria" size="4">Bored of cooking every day the 
					same meals, the same recipes, and want to try something 
					different and exotic?</font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
					<font face="Cambria" size="4">You can choose any culture, 
					any country you want and you will find specific traditional 
					foods for each and every one of them. But there is something 
					different about the way the Spanish cook, they just make 
					food a totally enjoyable experience&#8230; and this is what 
					matters and offers such tasty results.<br>
					First of all you have to know Spanish people like to eat a 
					lot of eggs. But they never, or almost never, eat boiled 
					eggs like we do. The traditional egg preparation method is 
					to scramble them and fry them, obtaining a delicious omelet 
					with potatoes and lots of onions added in the frying pan. 
					This is an exceptional and nutritional way to feed your 
					family for lunch.</font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
					<font face="Cambria" size="4">Another wonderful dish is the 
					paella&#8230; which means that you will pretty much throw in the 
					frying pan everything you have in your fridge. (Everything 
					that goes well with each other, of course.) The base for the 
					paella is usually obtained out of boiled chicken wings or 
					legs and to it we will add vegetables assorted to our taste. 
					It is important that we fry everything together in olive oil 
					for a better taste. We can even add fruits in the pan. After 
					everything is done, just a minute before turning off the 
					fire, we pour in the pan some natural juice or liqueur or 
					wine, whatever we want as long as we think we will like it. 
					And the result will be an absolutely extraordinary dish made 
					to fit our every taste and desire.</font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
					<font face="Cambria" size="4">Spanish desserts are often a 
					dream, but they can be rather difficult to prepare and they 
					usually contain lots of calories. Spanish cooking in 
					general is for people that really have time to spend in 
					the kitchen and enjoy doing it. Most Spanish dishes take a 
					long time to complete and a regular Spanish meal can require 
					up to 3 or even 4 dishes to serve.</font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
					<font face="Cambria" size="4">If you are willing to try but 
					don&#8217;t really have that much time then you can just go to a 
					Spanish restaurant near you and see for yourself the 
					wonderful cuisine of Spain.</font></p>
